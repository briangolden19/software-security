# software-security
# The client was Artemis Financial who wanted to make sure the security on their new online banking system was up to date and as secure as possible. 
# I think I did good in finding the small issues in their code that could let attackers in. It is important to code securely because it helps prevent attacks down the road. Software security adds value to the comapny because it allows clients to trust them. It also allows the comapany to not have to worry about spending money cleaning up any security mishaps that could happen. 
# I found that the vulnerability assessment was easy to work through because it was in clear step by step processes. 
# I approached the need to increase layers of security by making sure I added any of the ones necessary. 
# I made sure the code ran as intended and checked the dependency report before and after code refactoring to make sure no new issues were added into the project.
